1. RabbitMQ Command
- Running RabbitMQ: rabbitmq-server
- Stop RabbitMQ: rabbitmqctl stop
- Get Status RabbitMQ: rabbitmqctl status

---

2. Work Queues
- Work Queues using 'Round-robin dispatching'
- 'ack' parameter (acknowledgement) send back from consumer, to tell RabbitMQ has been received.
- debug 'forgotten acknowledgement': sudo rabbitmqctl list_queues name messages_ready messages_unacknowledged
- 'durable' parameter make sure the queue will survive when RabbitMQ node restart. Queues and messages are safe.

---

3. Publish/Subscribe
- Producer -> Exchange -> Queue -> consumer
- Exchange type: direct, topic, headers, fanout
- Command to see list exchange: sudo rabbitmqctl list_exchanges
- Relationship between exchange and a queue is called 'Binding'

---

4. Routing
- 'Direct' Exchange: a message goes to the queues whose binding key exactly matches the routing key of the message.

---

5. Topics
- Messages sent to a topic exchange can't have an arbitrary routing_key.
It must be a list of words, delimited by dots. The words can be anything, 
but usually they specify some features connected to the message. 
A few valid routing key examples: "stock.usd.nyse", "nyse.vmw", "quick.orange.rabbit".
